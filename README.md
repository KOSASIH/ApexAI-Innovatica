```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

# Define the input sequence length and vocabulary size
input_seq_length = 100
vocab_size = 10000

# Define the LSTM model architecture
input_layer = Input(shape=(input_seq_length,))
embedding_layer = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, 256)(input_layer)
lstm_layer = LSTM(256)(embedding_layer)
output_layer = Dense(vocab_size, activation='softmax')(lstm_layer)

# Create the model
model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy')

# Train the model on your dataset
model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=32, epochs=10)

# Generate text based on given prompts
def generate_text(prompt):
    # Tokenize the prompt
    prompt_tokens = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences([prompt])
    prompt_tokens = pad_sequences(prompt_tokens, maxlen=input_seq_length)

    # Generate text using the trained model
    generated_tokens = model.predict(prompt_tokens)
    generated_text = tokenizer.sequences_to_texts(generated_tokens)[0]

    return generated_text

prompt = "As a leading AI company in the healthcare industry, we strive to improve patient care through innovative solutions."
generated_text = generate_text(prompt)
print(generated_text)
```

This code sets up a natural language processing (NLP) model using LSTM to generate high-quality and coherent text based on given prompts. The model is trained on a dataset and can generate text for various industries. You can use this code to generate markdown code outputs for documentation or content generation. Just replace the `x_train` and `y_train` with your own training data, and adjust the `input_seq_length` and `vocab_size` according to your requirements.

To create a computer vision model that can accurately detect and classify objects in images, we can utilize deep learning techniques and pre-trained models. One popular approach is to use the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm, which provides real-time object detection.

Here is an example of how you can implement a computer vision model using the YOLO algorithm in Python using the OpenCV library:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load YOLO
net = cv2.dnn.readNet("yolov3.weights", "yolov3.cfg")

# Specify the output layers
layer_names = net.getLayerNames()
output_layers = [layer_names[i[0] - 1] for i in net.getUnconnectedOutLayers()]

# Load image
image = cv2.imread("image.jpg")

# Preprocess image
height, width, channels = image.shape
blob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(image, 0.00392, (416, 416), (0, 0, 0), True, crop=False)
net.setInput(blob)
outs = net.forward(output_layers)

# Initialize lists for detected objects
class_ids = []
confidences = []
boxes = []

# Process the output layers
for out in outs:
    for detection in out:
        scores = detection[5:]
        class_id = np.argmax(scores)
        confidence = scores[class_id]

        if confidence > 0.5:
            # Object detected
            center_x = int(detection[0] * width)
            center_y = int(detection[1] * height)
            w = int(detection[2] * width)
            h = int(detection[3] * height)

            # Calculate coordinates
            x = int(center_x - w / 2)
            y = int(center_y - h / 2)

            # Add detected objects to lists
            class_ids.append(class_id)
            confidences.append(float(confidence))
            boxes.append([x, y, w, h])

# Apply non-maximum suppression to remove redundant overlapping boxes
indices = cv2.dnn.NMSBoxes(boxes, confidences, 0.5, 0.4)

# Generate markdown output for detected objects
output = ""
for i in indices:
    i = i[0]
    box = boxes[i]
    x, y, w, h = box
    label = str(class_ids[i])
    confidence = confidences[i]
    output += f"- Object: {label}, Confidence: {confidence:.2f}, Location: ({x}, {y}), Width: {w}, Height: {h}\n"

print(output)
```

Please note that this code assumes you have the YOLO weights (`yolov3.weights`) and configuration file (`yolov3.cfg`) in the same directory as the script. Also, make sure to replace `"image.jpg"` with the path to the image you want to detect objects in.

This code will detect objects in the image and provide a markdown output describing the detected objects, their locations, and any relevant attributes or features.
